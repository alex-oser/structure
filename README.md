<h1 align="center">Welcome to structure üëã</h1>

Structure is an interactive design tool made for developers to help answer one question they have all asked before:

> How should I structure my code?

Any research on this topic quickly reveals that there is not one decisive answer.

Structure aims to help developers rapidly prototype their code and pick the structure that will work the best for them. It can also help to build the mental model of a project which enables a great developer experience.

Structure provides an E2E set of tools for designing repository structure which are all in the Structure GitHub organization.

- [Templates](https://github.com/structure-codes/templates)
- [VSCode extension](https://github.com/structure-codes/vscode-tree-language)
- [CLI tool](https://github.com/structure-codes/cli)

Most importantly, Structure relies on input from the community to add high quality templates for projects of all languages and frameworks.
